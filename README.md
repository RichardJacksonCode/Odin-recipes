# Odin-recipes
The first project of The Odin Project

As the title and subtitle say, this is my first project on The Odin Project(TOP to make it short), and the purpose of it is to create a basic recipe website that links to three webpages, each with their own recipe.

To make thing simple(and to avoid any copyright claim from another recipe website) I am using three pasta packets that I found at home and I will write the instruction on the back of them.

Easy.
